We wear green for st. patrick day.
BUT why don't we not wear any color for CODING DAYS?
st. patrick day people in Ireland celebrate st. patricks day like a parade or festival!
BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT in coding day why dont we wear a color?
BECAUSE everyone does not think coding should not be a holiday ( well st. patricks day is NOT a holiday) but I think coding should be a holaday because I like this cool teacher Rehan he is like my best friend.
